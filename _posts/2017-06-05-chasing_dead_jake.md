        description: "Chasing Dead is a story-based, Sci-fi First-Person Action Shooter. The game begins with a strange phenomenon in which another Earth appears in our skies. The curiosity and fear of a doppelganger planet initiates multiple missions in order to make contact with the duplicate Earth. A team of agents, astronauts, and scientists were sent 955,600 miles across space by NASA and the US Military, however all contact is lost a few hours after their arrival. You play as a marine named "Jake" who is sent on a mission to retrieve any research and data left behind by the original survey team while fighting off hostile forces."
