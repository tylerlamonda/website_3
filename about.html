title: About Me
name_var: about_me
about_me: "Hello, Iâ€™m Tyler La Monda. I have always been interested in Art and Technology. Majoring in Architecture allowed me the ability to cultivate my skills and regularly hover between the artistic and technical, collaborating effectively with artists and engineers across feature groups and cross-disciplines daily. When I originally became involved in the self-driving vehicle space I didn't fully understand the impacts my work could potentially have to keep people safe. Having had a family member die in a car accident, working in the field of autonomous vehicles has grown to a passion. Self-driven, design-obsessed, and high-performing creative leader - Energized by supporting others - Experienced in collaborating with creative, engineering and research teams globally to deliver value with a bias for action. Skilled in Maya, Unity, Unreal, Houdini, Figma, ZBrush, Nuke and Adobe suite (Ph,Ill,AE,PrP). Strong arts and design professional with a Master of Arts (M.A.) focused in Architecture from Royal College of Art."
